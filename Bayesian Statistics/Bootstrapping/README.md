# Non-Parametric Bootstrap:

In scientific research fields such as Astrophysics we often encounter measurements whose underlying distribution (Gaussian, Poisson, Binomialâ€¦) is unknown.
In such situations, the Non-Parametric Bootstrap technique is useful in approximating the underlying distribution of our measurement dataset.

Non-Parametric Bootstrap reveals a Normal Distribution:
