Non-Parametric Bootstrap:

In scientific research fields such as Astrophysics we often deal with measurements whose underlying distrubiton (Gaussian, Poisson, Delta..) is unknown.
In such situations, the Non-Parametric Bootstrap techniques is useful in approximating the underlying distribution of our measurement dataset.
