#### Notes:

* This is a model that works best with short-term (i.e. next day predictions) predictions
* The model was trained on 90-day points/prices to predict the 91st day price
* It can be modified to predict further days in the future (5-7 days) but is not recommended
considering the volatility of the dynamic stock market
* It is recommended to tweak the model with every stock or sector for best results
* A good application is day trading bots along with NLP (Sentiment Analysis) enhancements to buy the dips
